      <div class="recipe-ingredients">
        <ul>
          <li>40 mL XO brandy</li>
          <li>30 mL Cointreau (triple-sec)</li>
          <li>30 mL sweet red vermouth</li>
          <li>5 dashes orange bitters</li>
          <li>135 mL Grapefruit Soda (do not use infused water)</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p class="recipe-card-title">Instructions</p>
      <div>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Combine brandy, cointreau, vermouth, and bitters in a shaker. Shake
            lightly until chilled. Do not overshake.
          </li>
          <li>Strain into a tall tumbler with new large ice cubes.</li>
          <li>Add grapefruit soda and stir lightly to mix.</li>
          <li>Garnish with an orange slice if desired.</li>
        </ol>
        Notes: This recipe was created using brandy, but bourbon or whiskey can
        be substituted in quite well. Bourbon produces a smoother flavor and an
        overall milder cocktail. Other brands of triple sec will work alright
        but the cointreau will give the best flavor of the drink. The recipe was
        created with "Q" grapefruit soda and is the recommended brand to
        utilize, however, other brands will work. Please just make sure to use a
        true soda.

        <ul>
          <li>22 mL Dry Gin</li>
          <li>22 mL Campari</li>
          <li>22 mL Sweet Red Vermouth</li>
          <li>22 mL Herbal Liqueur (Elderflower or Benedictine)</li>
        </ul>

      <ol>
        <li>Combine all ingredients in a rocks glass with large ice.</li>
        <li>Stir to chill and combine.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Notes: The herbal liqueur can be either of the options listed, however,
        benedictine has proved to lend a more complex and satisfying flavor to
        the drink. If you are looking to alter this flavor try using different
        types of gin! Different varieties can lend a surprisingly different
        complexity and flavor profile depending on the botanicals and level of
        juniper.

          Slice 2 thin lime wheels from a clean lime and place in a tall glass
          with ice.
        </li>
        <li>Squeeze juice from the rest of the lime into the glass.</li>

      <div>
        <p>
          Notes: Any dry gin will work for this recipe but out of the gins
          tested the best options were Plymouth and Bombay Sapphire. <br />
          I recommend that you use "Fever-Tree" tonic water. The Refreshingly
          Light or Premium Indian works best in my opinion. They come in
          convenient mini cans. <br />
          If you don't have access to the liqueur, an elderflower tonic water
          will come close to the desired taste.

      <div class="recipe-card-title">
        <p>Instructions</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Combine lychee liqueur, campari, gin, Cointreau, & bitters in a
            shaker.
          </li>
          <li>
            Stir to combine and chill. If choosing to shake instead, make sure
            not to overshake.

          <li>Strain into tall rocks glass with fresh ice.</li>
          <li>Add bitters to the glass.</li>
          <li>Add grapefruit soda and gently stir twice.</li>
        </ol>
        <div>
          Notes: The proportions for this one needs adjustment but if anyone is
          experimenting with this one just make sure to keep the Gin as a larger
          component than anything else. The lychee is a very potent flavor and
          can easily eclipse the others. The recipe was created with "Q"
          grapefruit soda and is the recommended brand to utilize, however,
          other brands will work. Please just make sure to use a true soda.

          <div>
            Notes: This drink has a very strong herbal taste up front and
            finishes with a moderate anise flavor. Overall this a very intense
            tasting drink and while it is a pleasant flavor, it may not be
            favorable to everyone. Adjust absinthe and Chartreuse to taste if
            desired.
