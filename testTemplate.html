    Cocktail recipes are either original creations or alterations of existing recipes to satisfy my taste better.  Feel free to alter and try out new variations and if you make a substantial alteration that makes something better be sure to write it in here!


Cocktails will follow the same pattern in each recipe.

The Seaside
	
40 mL XO brandy
30 mL Cointreau (triple-sec)
30 mL sweet red vermouth
5 dashes orange bitters
135 mL Grapefruit Soda (do not use infused water)

Instructions:

Combine brandy, cointreau, vermouth, and bitters in a shaker.  Shake lightly until chilled.  Do not overshake.
Strain into a tall tumbler with new large ice cubes.
Add grapefruit soda and stir lightly to mix.
Garnish with an orange slice if desired.


Notes:  This recipe was created using brandy, but bourbon or whiskey can be substituted in quite well.  Bourbon produces a smoother flavor and an overall milder cocktail.  Other brands of triple sec will work alright but the cointreau will give the best flavor of the drink.
The recipe was created with &#34;Q&#34; grapefruit soda and is the recommended brand to utilize, however, other brands will work. Please just make sure to use a true soda. 

Health Potion 

22 mL (¾ oz) Dry Gin 
22 mLCampari
22 mL Sweet Red Vermouth
22 mL Herbal Liqueur (Elderflower or Benedictine)

Instructions:

Combine all ingredients in a rocks glass with large ice.
Stir to chill and combine.

Notes:  The herbal liqueur can be either of the options listed, however, benedictine has proved to lend a more complex and satisfying flavor to the drink.
If you are looking to alter this flavor try using different types of gin! Different varieties can lend a surprisingly different complexity and flavor profile depending on the botanicals and level of juniper. 




Bitter Rose

120 mL Tonic Water
75 mL Gin
25 mL Elderflower Liqueur
7 dashes Peychaud’s bitters
1 lime

Instructions:

Slice 2 thin lime wheels from a clean lime and place in a tall glass with ice.
Squeeze juice from the rest of the lime into the glass.
Add elderflower liqueur, gin, and tonic water to glass. 
Add bitters to the glass.
Stir lightly to combine.

Notes:  Any dry gin will work for this recipe but out of the gins tested the best options were Plymouth and Bombay Sapphire.
I recommend that you use &#34;Fever-Tree&#34; tonic water. The Refreshingly Light or Premium Indian works best in my opinion.  They come in convenient mini cans.
If you don&#39;t have access to the liqueur, an elderflower tonic water will come close to the desired taste. 



Misty Mountain
(Recipe Under Development, Use at own risk)

35 mL Dry Gin
20 mL Ciontreau
30 mL Dry Vermouth
20 mL Chartreuse Liqueur
15 mL Absinthe
115 mL Ginger Ale

Instructions: 

Combie gin, cointreau, vermouth, Chartreuse, &amp; absinthe in a cocktail shaker with ice.
Shake lightly to chill.
Add ginger ale and stir lightly to mix.

Notes: This drink has a very strong herbal taste up front and finishes with a moderate anise flavor.  Overall this is a very intense tasting drink and while it is a pleasant flavor, it may not be favorable to everyone.  Adjust absinthe and Chartreuse to taste if desired.  Use tonic water if you desire a stronger and less sweet drink.




Memories of a Mountain Sweets Shop
(Title is work in progress)

45 mL Bourbon
30 mL Cherry Cordial
15 mL Galliano
4-5 dashes Peychaud&#39;s Bitters

Instructions:

 Combine bourbon, cherry liqueur, galliano, and bitters in a shaker or glass with ice.
Stir to mix
Strain into glass with new ice

Notes:  This was made with Bulleit bourbon and is untested with a rye.  The drink is very smooth but has a strong nasal presence.  This drink instantly teleported me into a memory of a sweets shop in Highlands, NC getting caramel treats and hot cider on an early fall day.




Vacation to Okinawa
(Recipe is still in testing, use at own caution)

30 mL Lychee liqueur
20 mL Campari
45 mL Dry Gin
30 mL Cointreau
4-5 dashes Orange Bitters
125 mL Grapefruit Soda

Instructions: 

Combine lychee liqueur, campari, gin, Cointreau, &amp; bitters in a shaker.
Stir to combine and chill.  If choosing to shake instead, make sure not to overshake.
Strain into a tall rocks glass with fresh ice.
Add grapefruit soda and gently stir twice.

Notes: The proportions for this one needs adjustment but if anyone is experimenting with this one just make sure to keep the Gin as a larger component than anything else.  The lychee is a very potent flavor and can easily eclipse the others. The recipe was created with &#34;Q&#34; grapefruit soda and is the recommended brand to utilize, however, other brands will work. Please just make sure to use a true soda. 


Nostalgia

Trying to remember the actual recipe for this one.  Got tipsy and forgot to write it down.  Big dumb




Persephone’s Tears

45 mL Hpnotiq
30 mL Crème de Violette
30 mL Dry Vermouth
45 mL Dry Gin

Instructions:

Combine all listed ingredients in a shaker with ice.
Shake well to combine and chill.
Strain into a tall rocks glass with fresh ice.

Notes:
This recipe can be easily adjusted based on preferred taste.  If you like the taste of the tropical flavor more you can raise its proportion a bit and lower the Crème de Violette.  Do not lower the proportion of Gin significantly or the drink will taste too sweet.




Blushing Mermaid

45 mL Brandy
30 mL Sweet Red Vermouth
30 mL Maraschino Liqueur
4-5 dashes Angostura Bitters

Instructions:

Combine all listed ingredients in a shaker with ice.
Shake well to combine and chill.
Strain into a tall rocks glass with fresh ice.

Notes:  You can substitute whiskey in for the brandy if you would like, but be warned that something that is too mellow will not produce the desired balance.  I would recommend against using bourbon in this recipe.




Franko-Iberian Holiday
(Recipe &amp; name under development)

30 mL Tequila Blanco
30 mL Cointreau 
30 mL Hpnotiq

Instructions:

Combine all listed ingredients in a shaker with ice.
Shake well to combine and chill.
Strain into a tall rocks glass with fresh ice.

Notes:  This Drink is currently being tested for a 4th ingredient to balance out the overall sweetness of the drink.  At current it is an easy sipper, but lacks dimension.



Haven’t come up with a name yet
(Recipe &amp; name under development)

45 mL Tequila Blanco
20 mL Midori
15 mL Lychee Liqueur 
15 mL Dry Vermouth

Instructions

Combine all listed ingredients in a shaker with ice.
Shake well to combine and chill.
Strain into a tall rocks glass with fresh ice.

Notes: This recipe is currently too heavy on the lychee flavor and the midori gets somewhat drowned out by it. Possible directions currently being explored: increase the midori by 10 mL, increase the vermouth by 10 mL, add some aromatic bitters, add sake



Wandering Knight
(Recipe is still underdevelopment)

75 mL Becherovka
15 mL Benedictine
180 mL Premium Indian Tonic Water
~ half of 1 lime

Instructions

Cut 2 lime wheels from the lime and reserve the rest.
Put ice and the lime wheels into a tall glass.
Squeeze the rest of the lime for juice into the glass.
Pour the liquid components of the recipe into the glass.
Stir lightly to combine.

Notes:  This drinks similarly to a gin and tonic but it is noticeably sweeter and has a more intense flavor.  It is currently too sweet, so the recipe is under further development for how to retain the balance from the benedictine but without the sweetness.
